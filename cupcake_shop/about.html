        Chet Cupcakerson looked at the solid piano in his hands and felt happy.
        He walked over to the window and reflected on his affordable surroundings. He had always loved trendy Vancouver with its cuddly, colorful cafes. It was a place that encouraged his tendency to feel happy.
        Then he saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the figure of Cheryl Muffins. Cheryl was a proud gamer with ample eyebrows and tall legs.           
        Chet gulped. He glanced at his own reflection. He was a brave, noble, tea drinker with charming eyebrows and handsome legs. His friends saw him as an ashamed, agreeable angel. Once, he had even helped a curried kitten cross the road       
        But not even a brave person who had once helped a curried kitten cross the road, was prepared for what Cheryl had in store today.
        The rain hammered like dancing puppies, making Chet active.
        As Chet stepped outside and Cheryl came closer, he could see the curvy glint in her eye.
        "Look Chet," growled Cheryl, with a funny glare that reminded Chet of proud bears. "It's not that I don't love you, but I want desserts. You owe me 4101 dollars."
        Chet looked back, even more active and still fingering the solid piano. "Cheryl, I want cupcakes," he replied.
        They looked at each other with confident feelings, like two knobbly, kindly koalas laughing at a very virtuous party, which had classical music playing in the background and two clever uncles thinking to the beat.
        Chet regarded Cheryl's ample eyebrows and tall legs. "I don't have the funds ..." he lied.
        Cheryl glared. "Do you want me to shove that solid piano where the sun don't shine?"
        Chet promptly remembered his brave and noble values. "Actually, I do have the funds," he admitted. He reached into his pockets. "Here's what I owe you."
        Cheryl looked healthy, her wallet blushing like a thoughtful, thankful teapot.

        Then they opened Awesome Cupcakes.
